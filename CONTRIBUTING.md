## Issues and PRs

If you have suggestions for how this project could be improved, or want to report a bug, open an issue! We'd love all and any contributions. If you have questions, too, we'd love to hear them.

We'd also love PRs. If you're thinking of a large PR, please open up an issue first to discuss your proposed changes with a project maintainer!

## Submitting a pull request

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Configure and install the dependencies.
3. Make sure the tests and linters pass on your machine.
4. Create a new branch.
5. Make your change, add tests, and make sure the tests still pass.
6. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.
7. Pat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Write and update tests.
- Keep your changes as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).

Work in Progress pull requests are also welcome to get feedback early on, or if there is something blocking you.
