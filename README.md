Go to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and create a new project. In the authentication section at Firebase, enable sign-in with Google.

Next, make a copy of the .env.example file to .env and set the vars corresponding to your Firebase project. Generate and set the public encryption key and IV variables too which is used for email encryption.

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

You will be able to access the API from http://localhost:5000

### Testing

```bash
$ npm run test
```

### Deployment

In your .env, change the `NODE_ENV` to `production`. Launch a MongoDB Atlas instance and set the corresponding `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER` and `DB_USER_PWD` variables in the .env. Set the `CORS_URL` to the domain pointing to RocketMeet-client. Make sure to add that domain to the 'Authorized domains' section in your Firebase project. Make sure the Firebase and email encryption variables are set and correct.
