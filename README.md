## Problem

After my GSoC '20 at LiberTEM, I approached my mentors to know if I can have a video call with them. They said yes, and one of them sent me a link to a meeting poll created using a proprietary online service -- it had surprisingly bad UI and was covered with advertisements. I searched for good, ad-free, free and open source meeting poll tool, but didn't find any good ones at that time. So I got started, and now Kukkee has been used to schedule 2k+ meetings and has 250+ on GitHub.

## What is Kukkee?

Kukkee is a free, open source and fast meeting poll tool. It's built on top of Next.js and uses MongoDB as its data source. Quickly create a meeting poll by choosing the time slots based on your availability. Copy and share the poll link with the participants to let them mark their availability. Find the most popular times and see who's free with "yes" votes - or who can be - with "if need be" votes, and book the meeting! Create a poll now at [Kukkee.com](https://kukkee.com/)!

## Self-hosting

### Database

Kukkee uses MongoDB, hence you would need a MongoDB server hosted somewhere.

#### MongoDB Atlas

In case you don't have a hosted MongoDB server, you can [get started with MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/basics/mongodb-atlas-tutorial) for free. If you're planning to use Vercel to deploy your own Kukkee, you must add all IP addresses (0.0.0.0/0) to the IP access list of your Atlas cluster since it is not possible to determine the IP addresses of Vercel deployments.

### Deployment

Kukkee is built with Next.js, hence you would need to deploy Kukkee to a platform that supports Next.js (Vercel, AWS EC2, DigitalOcean Droplet, etc).

#### Vercel

In case you don't have a platform already, you can get started with Vercel for free.

1. Fork this repo to your own GitHub account and then clone it.
2. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
3. Create a new project
4. Import your forked git repository
5. Set the environment variables (according to the instructions in .env.example)
6. Deploy
