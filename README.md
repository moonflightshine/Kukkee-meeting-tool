Kukkee is a free and open source meeting poll tool to quickly find the perfect time which works for everyone without the back-and-forth texts/emails! Quickly create a meeting poll by choosing the time slots based on your availability. Copy and share the poll link with the participants to let them mark their availability. Find the most popular times and see who's free with "yes" votes - or who can be - with "if need be" votes, and book the meeting! Create a poll now at [Kukkee.com](https://kukkee.com/)!

## Motivation

After my GSoC '20 at LiberTEM, I wanted to have a video call with my mentors. They said yes, and since the next step was to find a suitable and common time, one of them sent me a link to a meeting poll created using a proprietary online service. It had surprisingly bad UX and was covered with advertisements. I searched for good, free and open source meeting poll tools, but didn't find any. So I decided to fix that problem.

## Get in touch

## Self-hosting

### Docker

Coming soon!

### Vercel and MongoDB Atlas

Kukkee is built with MongoDB and Next.js, so for a quick and free setup, you can use a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and Vercel's hobby plan.

You can get started with MongoDB Atlas for free [here](https://www.mongodb.com/basics/mongodb-atlas-tutorial). Make sure to add all IP addresses (0.0.0.0/0) to the IP access list of your Atlas cluster since it is not possible to determine the IP addresses of Vercel deployments.

You can get started with Vercel's hobby plan for free:

1. Fork this repo to your own GitHub account
2. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
3. Create a new project
4. Import your forked repository
5. Set the environment variables (according to the instructions in .env.example)
6. Deploy
