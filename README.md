## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* `NodeJS v14`

### Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/RocketMeet-mailer.git

$ cd RocketMeet-mailer

$ npm install
```

### Setup

Go to Firebase and create a project. In the authentication section, enable sign-in with Google. Then generate a private key from Project Overview > Project Settings > Service Accounts > Firebase Admin SDK. Next, make a copy of the .env.example file to .env and set the vars corresponding to the private key you generated. Then set the `EMAIL` and `PASSWORD` variables corresponding to your Gmail account used with Nodemailer. Make sure to use a spare account and [Turn on less secure app access](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps)

### Run

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

You will be able to access the API from http://localhost:8000

### Testing

```bash
$ npm run test
```

### Linting

We use `airbnb-typescript` style guide.
To check ESLint errors run the code below:
```bash
$ npm run lint
```
If you want to see ESLint errors on *realtime* install this ESLint extension from `Dirk Baeumer` for VSCode.

ðŸŒŸ *ESLint error will show in the PROBLEMS tab and on the actual line. When you will close the file, errors won't show in the PROBLEMS tab from that file. So, be cautious you might forget about the ESLint error. Recommended is before making PR you can run the above command to check if you missed any ESLint error to fix.*

### Deployment

In your .env, change the `NODE_ENV` to `production` and set the `EMAIL` and `PASSWORD` variables corresponding to your Gmail account. Make sure to use a spare account and [Turn on less secure app access](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps). Then set the CORS_URL to the domain running RocketMeet-client.
Make sure the Firebase credentials in .env are correct and that you added your domain to the 'Authorized domains' section in your Firebase project.
